# Desktop App Implementation Guide - WebSocket Connection System

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a WebSocket-based desktop app that connects to the deployed AutoReach Pro website, allowing remote control of Puppeteer automation for form filling.

## Architecture

### System Flow

```
Deployed Website (HTTPS) → WebSocket → Desktop App (Local) → Puppeteer → Browser Window
```

### Key Components

1. **Website**: Deployed AutoReach Pro (HTTPS)
2. **Desktop App**: Local Electron app with WebSocket server
3. **Puppeteer**: Browser automation running locally
4. **WebSocket**: Secure communication channel

## Security Model

### Connection Security

- **Binding**: Only to loopback (127.0.0.1/::1)
- **Origin Allowlist**: Strict domain validation
- **Token System**: One-time session tokens (2-5 minutes)
- **User Consent**: Native prompt for connection approval
- **Auto-close**: Inactivity timeout (10 minutes)

### Port Management

- **Available Ports**: 3000, 3001, 3002, 3003, 3004, 3005
- **Port Selection**: Auto-detect available port
- **Port Binding**: Random high port (3000-3005 range)

## Technical Specifications

### WebSocket Commands

```typescript
// High-level commands only
interface WebSocketCommands {
  OPEN: { url: string };
  FILL: Array<{ selector: string; value: string }>;
  SCREENSHOT: {};
  CLOSE: {};
  PAUSE: { message: string };
  RESUME: {};
}
```

### Desktop App Structure

```
desktop-app/
├── main/
│   ├── main.js              # Electron main process
│   ├── websocket-server.js  # WebSocket server
│   ├── puppeteer-handler.js # Puppeteer automation
│   └── security.js          # Security validation
├── renderer/
│   ├── index.html           # Desktop app UI
│   ├── pairing.js           # Pairing interface
│   └── status.js             # Connection status
└── package.json
```

### Website Integration

```typescript
// Website WebSocket client
class DesktopAppConnector {
  private ws: WebSocket | null = null;
  private port: number = 0;
  private token: string = "";

  async connect(): Promise<boolean> {
    // 1. Generate 6-digit code
    // 2. Wait for desktop app pairing
    // 3. Establish WebSocket connection
    // 4. Validate origin and token
  }

  async sendCommand(command: WebSocketCommands): Promise<any> {
    // Send command to desktop app
  }
}
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Initial Setup

1. User installs desktop app
2. User opens deployed website
3. User clicks "Connect Desktop App"
4. Website shows 6-digit pairing code

### 2. Pairing Process

1. User enters code in desktop app
2. Desktop app validates code with backend
3. Backend generates session token
4. WebSocket connection established

### 3. Form Automation

1. User selects contacts on website
2. User composes message
3. User clicks "Send Messages"
4. Website sends commands to desktop app
5. Desktop app opens browser window
6. Puppeteer fills forms
7. User reviews and submits
8. Screenshot captured
9. Results sent back to website

### 4. Connection Management

- Auto-close after 10 minutes inactivity
- Manual disconnect option
- Reconnection handling
- Error recovery

## Security Implementation

### Origin Validation

```typescript
const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
  "https://autoreachpro.com",
  "https://www.autoreachpro.com",
  "https://autoreach-pro.vercel.app",
];

function validateOrigin(origin: string): boolean {
  return ALLOWED_ORIGINS.includes(origin);
}
```

### Token System

```typescript
interface SessionToken {
  token: string;
  expiresAt: Date;
  origin: string;
  desktopAppId: string;
}

function generateSessionToken(origin: string): SessionToken {
  return {
    token: crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex"),
    expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 5 * 60 * 1000), // 5 minutes
    origin,
    desktopAppId: generateDesktopAppId(),
  };
}
```

### User Consent

```typescript
// Desktop app native prompt
function showConnectionPrompt(origin: string): Promise<boolean> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const dialog = require("electron").dialog;
    const result = dialog.showMessageBoxSync({
      type: "question",
      buttons: ["Allow", "Deny"],
      title: "Desktop App Connection",
      message: `Allow connection from ${origin}?`,
      detail: "This will allow the website to control form filling automation.",
    });
    resolve(result === 0);
  });
}
```

## Error Handling

### Connection Errors

- Port already in use → Try next port
- WebSocket connection failed → Retry with backoff
- Token expired → Regenerate pairing code
- Origin denied → Show error message

### Automation Errors

- Form not found → Report error to website
- CAPTCHA detected → Pause for user input
- Network timeout → Retry with longer timeout
- Browser crash → Restart browser instance

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Speed

- Target: ≤2s connection time
- WebSocket handshake optimization
- Port scanning efficiency
- Token validation speed

### Resource Management

- Browser instance pooling
