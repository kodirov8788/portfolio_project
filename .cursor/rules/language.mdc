# Internationalization: Japanese-First

1. Primary locale: Japanese (`ja`). All new or edited pages should default to natural, idiomatic Japanese, modeled on established Japanese websites.
2. Secondary locales (e.g., English) load only after Japanese content is in place.
3. Use i18next/react-i18next with locale order: `['ja', '<other_locale>']`.
4. Maintain parallel JSON resource files:
   - `locales/ja/common.json`
   - `locales/<other_locale>/common.json`
5. Keep identical key sets across all locale files.
6. Write Japanese copy that feels native—avoid literal machine translations.
7. Run your extraction and sync scripts after updating strings:
   - `yarn i18n:extract`
   - `yarn i18n:sync`
8. Validate that no keys are missing or untranslated before merging.
9. Review translations for cultural nuances and context accuracy.
10. Document any locale-specific formatting (dates, numbers) in code comments.
